# Multi-Agent Research Assistant - Complete Application Guide

This guide demonstrates how to build a sophisticated multi-agent application using the qwen_agent framework. We'll walk through creating a **Research Paper Writing Assistant** that showcases advanced multi-agent collaboration patterns.

## 🎯 Application Overview

The Research Paper Writing Assistant is a comprehensive multi-agent system that helps researchers write high-quality academic papers through intelligent collaboration between specialized AI agents and human researchers.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 6 specialized agents working together
- **Workflow Management**: Structured research paper writing process
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless human-AI collaboration
- **State Persistence**: Save and resume work sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in peer review and editing
- **Flexible Architecture**: Both GroupChat and Router patterns

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Agent Specialization

| Agent | Role | Capabilities | Tools |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Research Agent** | Literature review and source analysis | Find papers, analyze trends, identify gaps | web_search, doc_parser |
| **Outline Agent** | Paper structure and organization | Create outlines, organize content | doc_parser |
| **Writer Agent** | Content creation and writing | Write sections, maintain style | doc_parser |
| **Reviewer Agent** | Quality assessment and feedback | Peer review, accuracy checking | doc_parser |
| **Editor Agent** | Final editing and formatting | Polish text, format for journals | doc_parser |
| **Human Researcher** | Domain expertise and guidance | Provide direction, make decisions | N/A |

### Coordination Patterns

#### 1. **GroupChat Pattern** - Conversational Collaboration
```python
class GroupChat(Agent, MultiAgentHub):
    """Manages conversational flow between agents"""
```

**Flow:**
```
Human Request → Auto Router → Agent A → Auto Router → Agent B → ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Natural conversation flow
- Dynamic agent selection
- Context sharing across all agents
- Human interruption capability

#### 2. **Router Pattern** - Capability-Based Delegation
```python
class Router(Assistant, MultiAgentHub):
    """Routes requests to specialized agents"""
```

**Flow:**
```
User Request → Router Analysis → Delegate to Specialist → Return Response
```

**Benefits:**
- Efficient task routing
- Clear capability boundaries
- Scalable agent management
- Direct response integration

### Configuration

#### Agent Configuration (GroupChat)
```python
RESEARCH_PAPER_CFGS = {
    'background': 'Collaborative research environment...',
    'agents': [
        {
            'name': 'Research_Agent',
            'description': 'Literature review specialist',
            'instructions': 'Detailed role instructions...',
            'selected_tools': ['web_search', 'doc_parser']
        },
        # ... more agents
    ]
}
```

#### Router Configuration
```python
# Create specialized agents
research_agent = ReActChat(llm=llm_cfg, name='Research_Specialist', ...)
writing_agent = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, name='Academic_Writer', ...)

# Create router
router = Router(llm=llm_cfg, agents=[research_agent, writing_agent])
```

## 🔄 Workflow Management

### Workflow Stages

```python
class WorkflowStage(Enum):
    INITIALIZATION = "initialization"
    LITERATURE_REVIEW = "literature_review"
    OUTLINE_CREATION = "outline_creation"
    METHODOLOGY = "methodology"
    WRITING_DRAFT = "writing_draft"
    PEER_REVIEW = "peer_review"
    REVISION = "revision"
    FINAL_EDITING = "final_editing"
    SUBMISSION_PREP = "submission_prep"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
```

### State Management

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowState:
    current_stage: WorkflowStage
    completed_stages: List[WorkflowStage]
    paper_topic: str
    target_journal: str
    word_count_target: int
    current_word_count: int
    # ... more state fields
```

### Usage Example

```python
# Initialize workflow manager
manager = ResearchWorkflowManager(llm_config)

# Start new research project
manager.start_workflow(
    topic="AI in Climate Science",
    target_journal="Nature Climate Change",
    word_count=6000
)

# Continue workflow
while manager.workflow_state.current_stage != WorkflowStage.COMPLETED:
    manager.continue_workflow()

# Save progress
manager.save_workflow("my_research.json")
```

## 🎭 Multi-Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. **Sequential Collaboration**

```python
# Research → Outline → Write → Review → Edit
messages = [Message('user', 'Start research on topic X', name='Human_Researcher')]

for response in group_chat.run(messages):
    # Auto router selects next appropriate agent
    # Each agent builds on previous work
    # Human can interrupt and provide guidance
```

### 2. **Parallel Processing**

```python
# Multiple agents work on different aspects simultaneously
research_task = "Find literature on topic A"
analysis_task = "Analyze dataset B" 
writing_task = "Draft section C"

# Router delegates to appropriate specialists
for task in [research_task, analysis_task, writing_task]:
    router.run([{'role': 'user', 'content': task}])
```

### 3. **Iterative Refinement**

```python
# Write → Review → Revise → Review → Finalize
draft = writer_agent.run(messages)
feedback = reviewer_agent.run(draft)
revision = writer_agent.run(draft + feedback)
final = editor_agent.run(revision)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 1. **Dynamic Agent Selection**

The `GroupChatAutoRouter` intelligently selects the next speaker based on:
- Conversation context and history
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Current workflow stage
- User preferences and interruptions

```python
class GroupChatAutoRouter(Agent):
    def _run(self, messages):
        # Analyze conversation history
        # Consider agent capabilities
        # Select most appropriate next speaker
        # Can return [STOP] to end conversation
```

### 2. **Context Sharing**

All agents in a GroupChat share the complete conversation history:

```python
# Each agent sees full context
messages = [
    Message('user', 'Initial request', name='Human'),
    Message('assistant', 'Research findings', name='Research_Agent'),
    Message('assistant', 'Outline created', name='Outline_Agent'),
    # ... full conversation history
]
```

### 3. **Tool Specialization**

Agents have access to specific tools based on their roles:

```python
{
    'name': 'Research_Agent',
    'selected_tools': ['web_search', 'doc_parser'],  # Research tools
}
{
    'name': 'Data_Analyst', 
    'selected_tools': ['code_interpreter'],  # Analysis tools
}
```

### 4. **State Persistence**

Workflow state can be saved and restored:

```python
# Save current state
manager.save_workflow("research_project.json")

# Later: restore and continue
new_manager = ResearchWorkflowManager(llm_config)
new_manager.load_workflow("research_project.json")
new_manager.continue_workflow()
```

## 🎮 Interactive Examples

### Example 1: Literature Review

```
Human: "I want to research AI applications in drug discovery"

Research_Agent: "I'll search for recent papers on AI in drug discovery..."
→ Finds 15 relevant papers, summarizes key findings

Outline_Agent: "Based on the literature, I suggest this structure..."
→ Creates detailed paper outline with sections

Writer_Agent: "I'll draft the introduction section..."
→ Writes compelling introduction with proper citations
```

### Example 2: Methodology Design

```
Human: "We need a methodology for comparing ML models"

Methodology_Expert: "I recommend a comparative study design..."
→ Suggests experimental protocol and metrics

Data_Analyst: "For statistical analysis, we should use..."
→ Recommends statistical tests and visualization approaches

Reviewer_Agent: "The methodology looks solid, but consider..."
→ Provides feedback on potential limitations
```

### Example 3: Quality Assurance

```
Writer_Agent: "Here's the completed draft section..."

Reviewer_Agent: "I've reviewed the draft. Key issues:"
→ Identifies scientific accuracy concerns
→ Suggests improvements for clarity
→ Checks citation completeness

Editor_Agent: "Final editing recommendations:"
→ Grammar and style corrections
→ Journal formatting requirements
→ Reference list formatting
```

   - Retry mechanisms
   - Fallback agents

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Use lighter models for simple tasks
llm_config_light = {'model': 'qwen-turbo'}  # For routing/coordination
llm_config_heavy = {'model': 'qwen-max'}    # For complex analysis

# Implement caching
@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_agent_response(query_hash):
    # Cache frequent responses
```
