# MCP-Enhanced Software Development Multi-Agent System

## Overview

This document describes the MCP (Model Context Protocol) enhancement to the `software_dev_multi_agent.py` example. The enhanced version (`software_dev_multi_agent_mcp.py`) integrates MCP servers for build and test operations, providing isolated, reliable, and scalable development environments.

## Key Enhancements

### 🔧 MCP Server Integration
- **Build Server**: Dedicated MCP server for syntax checking, linting, and compilation
- **Test Server**: Specialized MCP server for test execution, coverage analysis, and validation
- **Isolated Operations**: All build and test operations run in isolated MCP server environments
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Server-based architecture provides better error handling and process isolation

### 🏗️ Enhanced Architecture

#### MCPSoftwareDevWorkspace Class
```python
class MCPSoftwareDevWorkspace:
    """Manages the software development workspace with MCP server integration."""
    
    def setup_mcp_servers(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Set up MCP servers for build and test operations."""
    
    def _create_build_mcp_server(self) -> Dict:
        """Create a build MCP server configuration."""
    
    def _create_test_mcp_server(self) -> Dict:
        """Create a test MCP server configuration."""
```

#### Enhanced Agent Configuration
- **MCP_Build_Agent**: Enhanced with MCP build server tools
- **MCP_Test_Runner_Agent**: Integrated with MCP test server capabilities
- **Server Integration**: All agents can leverage MCP servers for their operations

```python
def _create_build_mcp_server(self) -> Dict:
    """Create a build MCP server configuration."""
    # Create build server script with MCP protocol
    build_server_script = self.mcp_dir / "build_server.py"
    
    # Configure server with tools
    return {
        "command": sys.executable,
        "args": [str(build_server_script)],
        "env": {"PYTHONPATH": str(self.workspace_dir)}
    }
```

#### MCP Tool Integration
```python
def setup_mcp_servers(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """Set up MCP servers for build and test operations."""
    mcp_config = {
        "mcpServers": {
            "build_server": build_server_config,
            "test_server": test_server_config
        }
    }
    
    # Initialize MCP tools
    self.mcp_tools = self.mcp_manager.initConfig(mcp_config)
    return self.mcp_tools
```

#### Agent MCP Integration
```python
# MCP Build Agent with server tools
'selected_tools': ['code_interpreter'] + [name for name in mcp_tool_names if 'build' in name]

# MCP Test Runner Agent with server tools  
'selected_tools': ['code_interpreter'] + [name for name in mcp_tool_names if 'test' in name]
```
